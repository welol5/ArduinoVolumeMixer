# ArduinoVolumeMixer
This project is a simple volume mixer controlled by an arduino. The basic idea is that an arduino with 5 pots is used to send volume level information to a c# program that adjusts the individual program volumes. The c# program is meant to mimic the windows SndVol.exe.

# Discontinued
I am no longer working on this project due to some of the bugs I have encounterd. The main one being that it is hard to select what programs are controlled through only software. I think adding hardware to do this may be better and I am looking into that. The second issue is that I am in college and dont have the time to do as much research as I need to. In the future this repo will be replaced with the newer version.
